    given a matrix that represents a game of sudoku, solve the given game by filling in blank tiles
    randomly generate a solveable game of sudoku
    allow user to play game of sudoku and check whether correct at end



MVC idea:

        OPERATIONS
            solve() solves the sudoku board
            fill(x, y , number) fills a given cell according to coordinates provided with givne number
            delete(x,y) removes the number from a cell according to coordinates
            get_tile_val(x,y) returns the value from a specified tile
    controller - controls sequence of events according to user input by querying model and relaying data to view

ROHAN SUGGESTIONS:

    ids should never have spaces
    use target blank for a tags
    keep iconography more consistent
    change github icon to match other size
    Start from mobile to make it responsive
    big screens move buttons to side
    start cell form at 1
    hover effect for all buttons: solve and reset
    look at how to do ajax call
    jquery and javascript engine, include in base
    ajax call back to
    make bolded cells not clickable
